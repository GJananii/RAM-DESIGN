OVERVIEW:
This project focuses on developing a synchronous RAM module that supports read and write operations. The design ensures memory access is synchronized with a clock signal for reliable performance.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES:
Implement a synchronous RAM module using Verilog/VHDL.
Support read and write operations controlled by a clock signal.
Simulate the design to verify correct memory behavior.
DELIVERABLES
✔ Verilog/VHDL Code for RAM Module
✔ Testbench for Functional Verification
✔ Simulation Demonstrating RAM Functionality

INSTRUCTIONS:
Clone this repository.
Implement the RAM module in Verilog/VHDL.
Compile and simulate the design using an HDL simulator (ModelSim, Xilinx Vivado, etc.).
Run the testbench to verify read/write operations.
Analyze and document the simulation results.
